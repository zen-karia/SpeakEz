# SpeakEz ASL Learning App - Setup Instructions

## Overview
SpeakEz is an interactive ASL (American Sign Language) learning application that uses machine learning to recognize hand signs in real-time. The app features a Python Flask backend with TensorFlow models and a React frontend with webcam integration.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 16 or higher
- Webcam for real-time sign recognition
- Good lighting for accurate hand detection

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone and Navigate to Project
```bash
cd SpeakEz
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Key Dependencies:**
- TensorFlow 2.19.0 (matches model version)
- OpenCV 4.8.1.78
- MediaPipe 0.10.7
- Flask 2.3.3
- Flask-CORS 4.0.0

### 3. Install Frontend Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 4. Verify Model Files
Ensure these files are present in the root directory:
- `asl_letter_model_v3.keras` - Main ASL recognition model
- `scaler_v3.pkl` - Feature scaler
- `label_encoder_v3.pkl` - Label encoder
- `closed_fist_refiner.keras` - Refiner for closed-fist letters
- `closed_fist_le.pkl` - Closed-fist label encoder
- `bw_refiner.keras` - Refiner for B/W distinction
- `bw_le.pkl` - B/W label encoder

## Testing the Installation

### 1. Test TensorFlow Installation
```bash
python test_tensorflow.py
```
This should show:
- ‚úÖ TensorFlow 2.19.0 loaded successfully
- ‚úÖ All models loaded without errors
- ‚úÖ All dependencies working

### 2. Test Model Performance
```bash
python test_model.py
```
This opens a webcam window where you can test ASL recognition in real-time.

### 3. Test Backend API
```bash
python start_app.py
```
The Flask server should start on `http://localhost:5000`

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
python start_app.py
```
**Expected Output:**
```
üöÄ Starting ASL Recognition API (v3 with refiners)
‚úÖ Models loaded:
   - Main model: asl_letter_model_v3.keras
   - Closed fist refiner: closed_fist_refiner.keras
   - B/W refiner: bw_refiner.keras
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

### 2. Start the Frontend (New Terminal)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
**Expected Output:**
```
  VITE v4.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
```

### 3. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5173`

## Using the Application

### Interactive Learning Flow
1. **Grant Camera Permission**: Allow webcam access when prompted
2. **Practice Mode**: The app will randomly select letters from your practice set
3. **Make the Sign**: Show the requested ASL letter to your webcam
4. **Get Feedback**: 
   - ‚úÖ "Correct!" - Move to next letter
   - ‚ùå "Try again" - Keep practicing the same letter
5. **Progress**: Successfully recognized signs advance to the next letter

### Customizing Practice Letters
Edit `frontend/src/assets/components/Learn/LearnMain.jsx`:
```javascript
// Change this array to practice different letters
const practiceLetters = ['B', 'W']; // Example: only B and W
```

### Confidence Threshold
The app uses a 70% confidence threshold. You can adjust this in the frontend code if needed.

## Model Features

### Enhanced v3 Model
- **Main Model**: Uses MediaPipe hand landmarks and geometric features
- **Closed-fist Refiner**: Improves accuracy for A, E, O, S, M, N, T
- **B/W Refiner**: Distinguishes between B and W signs
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for interactive learning

### Supported Letters
The model recognizes all 26 ASL alphabet letters (A-Z) with enhanced accuracy for commonly confused signs.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. TensorFlow Import Errors
```bash
# If you get TensorFlow errors, ensure you have the correct version:
pip uninstall tensorflow
pip install tensorflow==2.19.0
```

#### 2. Model Loading Errors
```bash
# Test model loading:
python test_tensorflow.py
```
Ensure all model files are present and TensorFlow version matches.

#### 3. Webcam Not Working
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure no other applications are using the webcam
- Try refreshing the page

#### 4. Poor Recognition Accuracy
- Ensure good lighting
- Keep hand centered in frame
- Use plain background
- Make clear, deliberate signs

#### 5. Backend Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if backend is running:
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```
Should return: `{"status": "healthy", "model": "v3_with_refiners"}`

### Performance Tips
- **Lighting**: Bright, even lighting works best
- **Background**: Plain, uncluttered backgrounds
- **Hand Position**: Keep hand centered and fully visible
- **Sign Clarity**: Make deliberate, clear hand shapes
- **Distance**: Maintain consistent distance from camera
